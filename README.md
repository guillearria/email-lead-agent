# Winncom Lead Agent

## Project Overview

The Winncom Lead Agent is an automated email processing system designed to monitor a Gmail inbox, classify incoming emails as leads or information requests, generate appropriate responses, and forward them to human agents for review before sending.

## MVP Focus

For the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will focus on:
1. **Gmail Integration**: Setting up secure access to read emails from designated Gmail accounts
2. **Lead Identification**: Developing a system to accurately classify incoming emails as leads or information requests
3. **Basic Information Extraction**: Identifying key details from emails such as contact information and product interests

Later phases will incorporate response generation, knowledge base integration, and a more sophisticated review interface.

## Key Features

- **Gmail Integration**: Seamlessly connects with Gmail to monitor and process incoming emails
- **Email Classification**: Automatically categorizes emails as sales leads or information requests
- **Information Extraction**: Identifies and extracts key details from incoming emails
- **Response Generation**: Creates tailored responses based on email content and available knowledge base
- **Human Review Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for reviewing and approving generated responses
- **Web-Based Access**: Accessible via browser tab or potentially as a browser extension

   - Handle edge cases and ambiguous emails with a "needs review" category

3. **Information Lookup**
   - Access Winncom product database for accurate product information
   - Identify relevant product details needed for response
   - Support for expanding knowledge base over time
   - Cache frequently accessed information for performance

4. **Response Generation**
   - Create personalized, contextually appropriate responses
   - Include relevant product/service information
   - Maintain consistent brand voice and messaging
   - Support templates for common response types

5. **Human Review Process**
   - Present generated responses to human agents for review
   - Allow for editing before sending
   - Provide feedback mechanism to improve future responses
   - Track response status (pending review, approved, sent)

6. **User Interface**
   - Web-based dashboard accessible via browser
   - Intuitive interface for reviewing and managing emails
   - Notification system for new emails requiring review
   - Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go review

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Process emails within 5 minutes of scheduled check
   - Handle up to 20 emails per day (with capacity to scale)
   - Response generation completed within 30 seconds

2. **Security**
   - Secure OAuth 2.0 integration with Gmail
   - Encrypted storage of email content and responses
   - Role-based access control for human reviewers
   - Compliance with data protection regulations
   - Secure API communications with Winncom product database

3. **Reliability**
   - System uptime of 99.9%
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Backup and restore capabilities
   - Logging of all system activities for troubleshooting

4. **Scalability**
   - Support for multiple Gmail accounts/inboxes
   - Ability to handle increasing email volume
   - Modular architecture to allow for future enhancements

## Technology Stack (Proposed)

- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI) for email processing, classification, and response generation
- **Gmail Integration**: Gmail API with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- **Classification**: 
  - MVP: Rule-based system with keyword matching and basic NLP
  - Future: Machine learning models for improved accuracy
- **Frontend**: React for the web interface with Material UI components
- **Database**: 
  - PostgreSQL for structured data
  - Redis for caching frequently accessed information
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, cloud hosting (AWS/GCP)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

## Detailed MVP Specifications

### Gmail API Integration
- Use OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- Request read-only access to emails initially
- Implement webhook or polling mechanism to detect new emails
- Store email metadata and content securely
- Handle rate limiting and API quotas appropriately

### Lead Classification System
- Implement rule-based classification with the following categories:
  - New customer lead
  - Existing customer inquiry
  - Information request
  - Not relevant/spam
  - Needs human review
- Classification rules will consider:
  - Email sender domain and address
  - Subject line keywords
  - Email body content analysis
  - Presence of specific product mentions
  - Question patterns and request language

### Information Extraction
- Extract and structure the following data points:
  - Contact information (name, email, phone if available)
  - Company information
  - Product interests
  - Specific questions asked
  - Urgency indicators
  - Preferred contact method if specified

### Data Storage
- Secure database for storing:
  - Email metadata
  - Classification results
  - Extracted information
  - Processing status
  - Audit logs

## Open Questions (With Current Answers)

- **What is the expected volume of emails to process daily?**  
  Less than 10 per day initially, but needs further clarification.

- **Are there specific types of leads or information requests to prioritize?**  
  Yes, most leads will be from new or existing customers looking to improve their business with new computer products.

- **What existing systems (CRM, knowledge base) need to be integrated?**  
  We will need to integrate with the Winncom product database. This is a significant unknown that requires further investigation.

- **What is the desired response time for different types of emails?**  
  We eventually want to respond to all emails within 24 hours.

- **What metrics will be used to measure success?**  
  We will measure the quality of email classification and response generation. Manual review will be used initially.
