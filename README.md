# Winncom Lead Agent

## Project Overview

The Winncom Lead Agent is an automated email processing system designed to monitor a Gmail inbox, classify incoming emails as leads or information requests, generate appropriate responses, and forward them to human agents for review before sending.

## Key Features

- **Gmail Integration**: Seamlessly connects with Gmail to monitor and process incoming emails
- **Email Classification**: Automatically categorizes emails as sales leads or information requests
- **Information Extraction**: Identifies and extracts key details from incoming emails
- **Response Generation**: Creates tailored responses based on email content and available knowledge base
- **Human Review Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for reviewing and approving generated responses
- **Web-Based Access**: Accessible via browser tab or potentially as a browser extension

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Email Monitoring**
   - Connect to Gmail accounts via OAuth
   - Monitor inbox for new emails in real-time or on a schedule
   - Process various email formats (plain text, HTML, with attachments)

2. **Email Classification**
   - Analyze email content to determine if it's a lead or information request
   - Extract key information (contact details, specific interests, questions)
   - Handle edge cases and ambiguous emails

3. **Information Lookup**
   - Access company knowledge base, product information, or CRM data
   - Identify relevant information needed for response
   - Support for expanding knowledge base over time

4. **Response Generation**
   - Create personalized, contextually appropriate responses
   - Include relevant product/service information
   - Maintain consistent brand voice and messaging

5. **Human Review Process**
   - Present generated responses to human agents for review
   - Allow for editing before sending
   - Provide feedback mechanism to improve future responses
   - Track response status (pending review, approved, sent)

6. **User Interface**
   - Web-based dashboard accessible via browser
   - Intuitive interface for reviewing and managing emails
   - Notification system for new emails requiring review

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Process emails within [X] minutes of receipt
   - Handle up to [X] emails per day

2. **Security**
   - Secure OAuth integration with Gmail
   - Encrypted storage of email content and responses
   - Role-based access control for human reviewers

3. **Reliability**
   - System uptime of 99.9%
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Backup and restore capabilities

4. **Scalability**
   - Support for multiple Gmail accounts/inboxes
   - Ability to handle increasing email volume

## Technology Stack (Proposed)

- **Backend**: Python (Flask/FastAPI) for email processing, classification, and response generation
- **Frontend**: React for the web interface
- **Email Integration**: Gmail API
- **Classification**: Rule-based system initially, with potential ML integration later
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, potentially with vector capabilities for semantic search
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, cloud hosting (AWS/GCP)

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up project structure and development environment
- Implement Gmail API integration
- Create basic email processing pipeline
- Develop simple classification rules

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Build response generation system
- Develop human review interface
- Implement feedback mechanism
- Create basic dashboard

### Phase 3: Enhancement
- Improve classification accuracy
- Expand knowledge base integration
- Add analytics and reporting
- Optimize performance

### Phase 4: Deployment & Scaling
- Comprehensive testing
- Production deployment
- User training
- Monitoring and maintenance plan

## Open Questions

- What is the expected volume of emails to process daily?
- Are there specific types of leads or information requests to prioritize?
- What existing systems (CRM, knowledge base) need to be integrated?
- What is the desired response time for different types of emails?
- What metrics will be used to measure success?

## Next Steps

1. Finalize requirements and specifications
2. Create detailed system architecture
3. Develop proof-of-concept for email classification
4. Design user interface mockups
5. Set up development environment and project structure
